How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    As you see changes only your could easily catch any typos and mistakes.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You can experiment with different features/approaches and easily return
    to old versions when results are unsatisfactory.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: each commit is finished logical change
    Cons: the save period could be too big

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Apps consist of more than 1 file which are interconnected so it's important
    to track them together.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log shows the whole list of commits with unique IDs
    git diff compare commits between each other

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You could easily return to any previous versions to catch the point of
    bug inception.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Creating and managing own commits.
